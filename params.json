{"name":"Cx","tagline":"A scripting language for fun and profit.","body":"Cx\r\n==\r\nA scripting language for fun and profit.<br>\r\n``` cpp\r\nuse io;\r\n\r\nio.puts(\"Hello, World!\");\r\n\r\nreturn 0;\r\n```\r\n\r\nCx syntax is designed to be a hybrid of C++ and C#. What makes Cx unique is the ability to easy extend the language using C or C++. Even basic data types can be extended to add functionality.<br>\r\nAll data types can be extended by additional class declarations. This makes it easy to define objects in C/C++ to later extend those objects in Cx without having to recompile the library.<br>\r\nFor example, the below code will add the function <i><b>is_digit</b></i> to the basic Cx char type.\r\n``` cpp\r\nclass char {\r\n    /** is_digit - Check if character is decimal digit\r\n     * Checks whether \"this\" is a decimal digit character.\r\n     * Decimal digits are any of: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \r\n     *\r\n     * @param this : char to test if digit.\r\n     * @return true if digit, false if not. */\r\n     \r\n    bool is_digit() {\r\n        return ((this >= '0') && (this <= '9'));\r\n    }\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe added function can then be called as follows:\r\n``` cpp\r\nchar c = '5';\r\nif(c.is_digit)\r\n\t// true\r\nelse\r\n\t// false\r\n```\r\n### Supported compilers and platforms\r\nPopular compilers which support C++11 are used to build the Cx interpreter.\r\n\r\n* clang++\r\n* g++4.7 or later\r\n* VS 2012 express\r\n\r\nCx language features are restricted to the C++11 standard library and will compile on OSX, Linux, and Windows. Any features deemed platform specific will be implemented in dynamic libraries which can be loaded at run-time.\r\n\r\n### Cx Documentation\r\nAll documentation will be posted and updated at the link below. More information may be found in Cx/doc\r\n* [Cx-doc](https://github.com/ahebert/cx/wiki)\r\n\r\n### Status\r\nThis project is for educational purposes only and is still in early development.<br>\r\n\r\n### Getting involved\r\n* Fork a copy of the repo.\r\n* Create one branch per feature/bug fix.\r\n* Submit pull request to develop branch for code review.\r\n* ???\r\n* profit!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
